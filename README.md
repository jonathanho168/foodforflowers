## Inspiration

Eating disorders hit really close to home. Over the years, we’ve seen for ourselves how quickly the current apps on the market are not only tedious and error-prone, but can (more concerningly) make us overfixate on some specific number, make us incredibly restrictive in our habits, and so much more…

## What it does

With Food for Flowers, we create a supportive community and foster a positive and inclusive environment that motivates our users to achieve their goals in a healthy and sustainable way. Nurture a garden together with your significant other! Travel around to find out which of your friends are budding landscape architects! Learn some new recipes and cool fun facts through our Updates for you!

It’s time we focussed on qualitative goals and developing maintainable, sustainable habits that promote long-term physical and mental health, rather than fixating on metrics that are easily misunderstood. Come have fun with us — your body, your garden!

## How we built it

The interactive, customisable garden is built using Unity. The app is built using React and Typescript. We call on the Spoonlicious API to identify food item and their nutritional value, model the data, and feed it into the OpenAI GPT-3 API to generate user-specific recommendations every two weeks. Design and ideation took place on whiteboards, printer paper, and Figma.
